# ProDev Backend Engineering Journey

##  Project Objective

This repository documents my journey through the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**. It serves as:

* A **reference guide** for key backend technologies, concepts, and tools.
* A **record of challenges and solutions** I faced along the way.
* A **collaboration hub** with both frontend and backend learners.
* A way to **consolidate learnings** for future growth.


##  Key Technologies Learned

* **Python** – Core programming language for backend development.
* **Django** – High-level Python web framework for building scalable apps.
* **Django REST Framework (DRF)** – For building RESTful APIs.
* **GraphQL** – Alternative to REST, enabling flexible and efficient data queries.
* **Docker** – Containerization for consistent deployment.
* **CI/CD Pipelines** – Automating build, test, and deployment processes.

##  Important Backend Development Concepts

1. **Database Design & Management** – Designing schemas, relationships, and queries (PostgreSQL, MySQL).
2. **Asynchronous Programming** – Using async features for concurrency and better performance.
3. **Caching Strategies** – Redis/memory caching to improve response times.
4. **Message Queues** – RabbitMQ and Celery for task scheduling and background jobs.
5. **System Design** – Structuring scalable and reliable backend systems.

##  Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Setting up CI/CD for the first time

* **Challenge:** Difficulty automating build and deployment.
* **Solution:** Learned GitHub Actions & automated testing workflows.

### 2. Debugging complex API integration with frontend

* **Challenge:** Mismatched data between frontend and backend.
* **Solution:** Used Postman and DRF browsable API to test endpoints thoroughly.

### 3. Managing asynchronous tasks with Celery & RabbitMQ

* **Challenge:** Long-running background tasks failing.
* **Solution:** Broke tasks into smaller units and used monitoring tools (Flower) to track execution.

### 4. Dockerizing Django apps with proper networking

* **Challenge:** Database container not connecting with the app.
* **Solution:** Used Docker Compose to manage containers for app + database + cache.


##  Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

* Write clean, modular code (follow PEP8 and Django best practices).
* Test everything – unit tests, integration tests, API endpoint tests.
* Use version control properly – commit often, write meaningful commit messages.
* Collaborate effectively – share API docs clearly for frontend learners.
* Think scalability early – plan for caching, load balancing, and async tasks.
* Keep learning – backend engineering is an evolving field; continuous learning is key.

##  Collaboration

### Who I Collaborated With

* **Backend learners** – Peer reviews.

### Where We Collaborated

* **Discord Channel:** `#ProDevProjectNexus` – For sharing ideas, solving blockers, and keeping up with staff announcements.


##  Next Steps

1. Contribute to open-source backend projects.
2. Deepen knowledge of **system design & scalability**.
3. Explore **microservices architecture** with Django + FastAPI.
4. Mentor future ProDev learners.
